			A water fund is a source water protection mechanism that pools funding from downstream beneficiaries to invest in upstream source water protection activities.  Water funds have four common characteristics: science-based plans, a multi-stakeholder approach, a funding mechanism and implementation capacity.  The Water Funds Explorer allows users to learn about operational water fund programs of The Nature Conservancy and its partners.
